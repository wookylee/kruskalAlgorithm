# kruskalAlgorithm

Kruskal’s algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that finds an edge with the least possible weights of two nodes. <br>
In order to implement the Kruskal’s algorithm, we make a structure of the edge that will connect the nodes and, in the end, make a tree for the whole graph.

There are some input files and the result files attached to show how it works.
