# kruskalAlgorithm

Kruskal’s algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that finds an edge with the least possible weights of two nodes. <br>
In order to implement the Kruskal’s algorithm, we make a structure of the edge that will connect the nodes and, in the end, make a tree for the whole graph.
<br>
<br>
There are some input files and the result files attached to show how it works.<br>
The first line of the input file means number of nodes, and the number of edges <br>
the rest of the lines are two nodes and the weight of the edge <br>
The output file shows the two nodes that the kruskal Algorithm spans.
